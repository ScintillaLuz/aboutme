                Ten years ago I started as a professional graphic designer. Today I work as a webdesigner, mockupping webapps, designing <strong>UI elements</strong> and building styleguides. I draw <strong>icons</strong>, <strong>illustrations</strong>–both hand-drawn and vector–but I am also proficient with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Stylus</strong> preprocessing. I love the terminal, Sublime Text and know my way with <strong>Git</strong>; I built my own <a href="http://scintillaluz.github.io/waffle/"><strong>CSS framework</strong></a> and I coded markup and style of my own products. I develop <strong>visual identities</strong>, logos, online and offline layouts, give talks. In the past I've optimized and kerned typeface, designed books and magazines, wrote about cognitive psychology, usability, visual communication and media. Want to know more? Just scroll down.

                    <h4>Creativity</h4>
                    <p>
                        I believe design is problem-solving: find a solution to a problem applying a method. Creativity means simplifying these solutions, coming right after research and analysis, but before prototyping and testing. As Munari wrote, the new designer '...knows how to approach human needs according to a precise method. We wish to make him conscious of his creative power, not scared of new facts, and independent of formulas in his own work.'

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>I believe in research, and to support design decisions with data
                        Creativity means simplifying these solutions, coming right after research and analysis, but before prototyping and testing. 'Creativity depends on number of connections we build between things learned or experienced'. That's why even when I draw conclusions based on my 'designer's intuition', I am in fact relying on previous experience. There's no such thing as an 'uninformed' decision.

                    <h4>Control</h4>
                    <p>There's a time for falling in love with an idea, and a time for breaking up. As a designer, whenever I felt stuck in a project, I started 'from scratch'. Later on, I became aware that time means affection; and that affection makes it difficult to let go of an idea, even when it is not an effective solution. I trust testing as the real hard-proof of design, no matter how much I loved my creation. As a designer, I do not work for my private enjoyment,

                    <p>What happens when you want to learn HTML/CSS and Stylus the hard way? What can you do when you're building webapps and tweaking an existing framework seems a counterproductive job? If you are me, you'll probably decide to <strong>build your own CSS framework</strong>. This is why I built <strong>Waffle</strong>, the first cannibal (and lightweight) <strong>responsive CSS framework based on inline-block</strong>. No clearing floats, no scary combinations of classes.</p>
                    <p>Compiled in <strong>Stylus</strong>, Waffle is <strong>open source</strong> and released under <strong>MIT Licence</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The most painful moment in a designer's life is the moment you have to build your online portfolio. Every tool is unsatisfactory, not fitting your workflow. Working as a Dropbox app, Isoverse makes it possible to publish a website from your computer, seamlessly and instantly. Working with the tools you already know.</p>
                    <p>I worked on <strong>visual identity and strategy</strong>; UI and guidelines, UX and user flows, <strong>HTML</strong> (with <strong>Django templates</strong>) and <strong>CSS</strong> (vanilla and <strong>Stylus</strong>), creating both the static site and the portfolio templates we offer. Isoverse is running on the latest version of Waffle; I've been porting various parts of it from an old version–a valuable experience in <strong>reading and rewriting your old code</strong>.</p>

                    <p>When my co-founder and I decided to pivot from a social bookmarking platform, we analyzed the data we had on users and content and we realized we indeed attracted mostly programmers. The result is <strong>Devcharm</strong>, a collaborative and open library about programming and development. Even though it fell short on attracting UG content, I worked passionately building the <strong>HTML</strong> using <strong>Django templates</strong>, <strong>UI</strong> elements, guidelines and styles with <strong>Stylus</strong>, along with <strong>interactions and UX</strong>. Devcharm is build upon an early version of Waffle.</p>
                    <p>I contributed to Devcharm with a first article about <a href="https://devcharm.com/articles/272/understanding-and-fixing-a-detached-head-in-git/" target="_blank"><strong>understanding and fixing a detached head in Git</strong></a>.</p>

                    <p>When I heard a Mozilla Evangelist presenting the Firefox Phone I was suddenly fascinated by the idea of a totally open mobile OS, entirely based on HTML5 and Javascript.</p>
                    <p>I proposed my collaborators to develop a <strong>simple utility app</strong>, for saving and reading links offline–saving bandwith is essential for these entry phones marketed primarily in the developing countries–and in a few days we produced <a href="http://getmanana.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Manana</a>. For this project I focused entirely on interactions, users flow and UX, UI and icon design. You can see mockups and icons in detail <a href="http://scintillaluz.isoverse.us/work/140-manana" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>I still consider myself a <strong>typographer</strong>, an expert of typography in the context of its use. My MA at the Department of Typography at Reading focused on Book Design, but my research included topics of <strong>cognitive psychology</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong>. Neverthless, one of my favourite projects was designing a series of book covers, in my case I picked a rebranding of sci-fi to elevate the visual approach of the genre.</p>
                    <p>I was very happy when <strong>Heyne decided to publish</strong> a series of modern and contemporary sci-fi classics <strong>using my watercolor illustrations</strong>. They changed the typography, but I am still enormously proud to see my design on Neuromancer.</p>

                    <p>From <strong>content planning</strong> to <strong>micro-typography</strong>, this exercise on book design was a way to practise almost all the skills I've been training for years. I choose the topic, analyzed the market for it, devised in which parts to divide the book and a sequence of chapters; then I worked out <strong>grids</strong>, <strong>typography</strong>, <strong>diagrams</strong>, <strong>illustrations</strong> and <strong>cover design</strong>. I finalized 'The Symbolic Language of Tarot Cards' with a hand bookbinded prototype.</p>
                    <p>As a manual about foretelling with Tarot cards, this book was as much about user interface as graphical arrangement of elements. When I was finished I was asked myself, <strong>why not making a webapp</strong> for reading the future with Tarot Cards? Probably, my next personal project.</p>

                            <p><strong>Every typographical choice has a direct impact on the users</strong>. Typesetting and layout are simply given, in the eye of the reader; to achieve the result of a 'crystal clear' page, as a typographer I must combine grids and typefaces around the message of the text itself.</p>

But freelancing <strong> lacked continuity</strong>, which I consider crucial for growing.</p>
